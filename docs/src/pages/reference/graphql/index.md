title: GraphQL in Site
---

<Intro>
All that is needed to create a fully functioning GraphQL server is to create a schema.

A single graphQL compliant schema file provides Site with all the data it needs to expose a GraphQL endpoint, transct or query data with XTDB and validate the incoming and outgoing data.

## Creating a schema {/_creating-a-schema_/}

The following is a simple example of a schema file.

<APIAnatomy title="schema.graphql">

<AnatomyStep title="Define a schema type">

This type declares a Query and Mutation type and also sets the 'Site Type' to `myapp/type`. The 'Site Type' is transcted on every document when you use a mutation defined in this schema.

</AnatomyStep>

<AnatomyStep title="Define your data model">

Any 'Type' definition not used in the above schema can be used as return types in your queries and mutations. Site has several built-in [Scalar Types](/reference/graphql/scalars) but you can also define your own.

</AnatomyStep>

<AnatomyStep title="Define Mutations">

A mutation takes arguments (in parentheses) and returns a Type which must be defined in this schema. By default mutations are 'Create' operations and will auto-generate a unique ID for the new document. You can specify other types of mutation with [Directives](/reference/graphql/site-directive).

</AnatomyStep>

<AnatomyStep title="Define Queries">

Queries are defined with the same syntax as mutations, though the possible directives are different. By default a query looks up all documents with a matching 'Site Type' to the return type of the query. You can specify other types of query with [Directives](/reference/graphql/site-directive).

</AnatomyStep>

```graphql [[1, 5], [6, 17], [18, 23], [24, 29]]
schema @site(type: "myapp/type") {
  query: Query
  mutation: Mutation
}

type Episode {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
}

type Character {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  episodeId: ID!
  appearsIn: [Episode] @site(ref: "episodeId")
}

type Mutation {
  createCharacter(name: String!, episodeId: ID!): Character

  createEpisode(name: String!): Episode
}

type Query {
  character(id: ID!): Character
  characters: [Character]
  charactersById(ids: [ID!]!): [Character]
  episodes: [Episode]
}
```

</APIAnatomy>

Common types of query:

There are many common queries you might want to do when you have data inserted in Site. The simplest is a lookup by the ID of the object you wish to query. If you write a query in your schema with a single 'id' argument, site will look that id up in the database (while applying all authz rules) and return it if it exists and you are allowed to see it. The same is true for a single ids argument, but a list of matching types are returned.
